# Graded Lattices

**Graded Lattices** is a software tool for generating continuously graded CAD models of plate lattice structures. It enables users to design lightweight, mechanically optimized lattices with smooth geometric transitions, making it suitable for advanced engineering applications.

The software is built around a custom algorithm that allows precise control over lattice geometry through parametric inputs. Users can adjust lattice dimensions, grading intensity, and combine different lattice types into hybrid structures — all within a single interface. This makes the tool particularly useful for research, simulation, and optimization studies.

## Features
- Continuous geometric grading of plate lattices
- Parametric control over lattice dimensions and grading patterns
- Support for hybrid lattice configurations
- Export of CAD-ready geometry for simulation and analysis
